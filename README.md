### A sleek customization for the nice!view shield

Add this shield to your keymap repo (see usage below) and run the GitHub action to build your firmware.

### Features

- Uses a **fixed range for the chart and gauge deflection**. 📈
- Includes a **beautiful animation** for the peripheral of split keyboards. 💎
- Comes with **pixel-perfect symbols** for BLE and USB connections. 📡

## Usage

To use this shield, first add it to your `config/west.yml` by adding a new entry to remotes and projects:

```yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: m165437 #new entry
      url-base: https://github.com/M165437 #new entry
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: nice-view-gem #new entry
      remote: m165437 #new entry
      revision: main #new entry
  self:
    path: config
```

Now, simply swap out the default nice_view shield on the board for nice_view_gem in your `build.yaml` file.

```yml
---
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: kyria_left nice_view_adapter nice_view_gem #updated entry
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: kyria_right nice_view_adapter nice_view_gem #updated entry
```

Finally, make sure to enable the custom status screen in your ZMK configuration:

```conf
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY=y
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_STATUS_SCREEN_CUSTOM=y
```

## Configuration

Modify the behavior of this shield by adjusting these options in your personal configuration files. For a more detailed explanation, refer to [Configuration in the ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/config).

| Option                                     | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `CONFIG_NICE_VIEW_GEM_WPM_FIXED_RANGE`     | bool | This shield uses a fixed range for the chart and gauge deflection. If you set this option to `n`, it will switch to a dynamic range, like the default nice!view shield, which dynamically adjusts based on the last 10 WPM values provided by ZMK.                | y       |
| `CONFIG_NICE_VIEW_GEM_WPM_FIXED_RANGE_MAX` | int  | You can adjust the maximum value of the fixed range to align with your current goal.                                                                                                                                                                              | 100     |
| `CONFIG_NICE_VIEW_GEM_ANIMATION`           | bool | If you find the animation distracting (or want to save on battery usage), you can turn it off by setting this option to `n`. It will instead pick a random frame of the animation every time you restart your keyboard.                                           | y       |
| `CONFIG_NICE_VIEW_GEM_ANIMATION_MS`        | int  | Alternatively, you can slow down the animation. A high value, such as 96000, slows the animation considerably, showing the next frame every couple of seconds. The animation consists of 16 frames, and the default value of 960 milliseconds plays it at 60 fps. | 960     |
